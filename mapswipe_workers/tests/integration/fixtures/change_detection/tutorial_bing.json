      "pre": "For this project we are looking for changes regarding settlements. Compare the upper (before) and lower (after) image and *SWIPE RIGHT* (not tap) to indicate that new settlements have been built.",
      "post_correct": "Yes, that looks like a new settlement being developed. Plenty of new houses and huts have been built in this area. Swipe left to continue the tutorial.",
      "post_wrong": "Oh no. Make sure to spot all the new settlements and swipe right. New roads can also function as an indicator sometimes."
    },
    "changes_2": {
      "pre": "And again: If new settlements have been built, *SWIPE* to the right side.",
      "post_correct": "Correct. We can spot new settlements in the upper right part of the satellite image. Swipe left to go on with some more examples.",
      "post_wrong": "Take a closer look. There are new settlements here in the upper right part of the satellite image."
    },
    "changes_3": {
      "pre": "Sometimes settlement might also disappear because they have been pulled down or destroyed. Also for this case *SWIPE RIGHT* to indicate that the situation changed.",
      "post_correct": "Correct. We can detect some settlements that have been demolished here.",
      "post_wrong": "Take a closer look. There are settlements in the upper image that are not there in lower one."
    },
    "no_changes_1": {
      "pre": "In this example, there are many buildings but *NO CHANGES* in settlements can be observed. *SWIPE* left to indicate no changes.",
      "post_correct": "Nice. Just watch out for changes referring to settlements. Swipe left to continue.",
      "post_wrong": "Oh no. Not all changes refer to new settlements, some are just related to agriculture or vegetation."
    },
    "no_changes_2": {
      "pre": "We might spot changes in the vegetation for this imagery pair, but no changes related to settlements. Again, *SWIPE LEFT*.",
      "post_correct": "Cool. You got it. Just look out for changes concerning settlements.",
      "post_wrong": "Sorry, try again. Don't be distracted by changes in vegetation, just look out for settlements."
    },
    "maybe_1": {
      "pre": "Sometimes it might be unclear if settlements emerged. Swipe down if you are not sure.",
      "post_correct": "Great. We cannot really tell if the building at the bottom left is a new settlement. This is a 'maybe'.",
      "post_wrong": "Are you really sure? Sometimes it's better to mark the imagery as 'not sure'."

    "bad_imagery_1": {
      "pre": "Swipe up to indicate if there is no imagery or if there are clouds.",
      "post_correct": "That's right, that image was way too cloudy to make a good assessment!",
      "post_wrong": "It there is no imagery or clouds, we cannot tell the right answer. Make sure to mark this as well by swiping up."
