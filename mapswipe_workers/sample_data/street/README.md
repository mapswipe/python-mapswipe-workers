## Add exported Mapillary images as geotagged images in QGIS

1. Open QGIS
2. **Processing Toolbox > Vector creation > Import geotagged photos**
3. Select the folder containing all exported Mapillary images and check **Scan recursively**
4. **Run**
5. **Properties > Display** and add `<img src="file:///[% photo %]" width="350" height="250">` to HTML Map Tip to show images on a pop up
6. **View > Show Map Tips**
7. If you keep the mouse tip on the image markers, a pop up with the image will appear
